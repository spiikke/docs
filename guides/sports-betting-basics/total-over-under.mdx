A total bet is wagering on the combined score of both teams being over or under a set number.

## Example: NFL Game Total 47.5

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Over 47.5">

Wins if 48 or more points are scored

</Tab>

<Tab title="Under 47.5">

Wins if 47 or fewer points are scored

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
**Note:** If total was an integer and the exact number is hit, that's a push (though books often use .5 increments to avoid pushes).
</Info>

<Tip>
Total bets are independent of which team wins - you're betting on the combined score of both teams.
