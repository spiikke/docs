A spread (or line) is a handicap to even the playing field. You bet on a team to cover the spread:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Favorite (-5.5)">

Must win by 6 or more for a bet on them to win

</Tab>

<Tab title="Underdog (+5.5)">

Can lose by 5 or fewer, or win outright, and a bet on them wins

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Push Concept

If the result lands exactly on the spread (for whole number spreads), it's usually a push (bet refunded). Spreads often use half-points to avoid pushes.

<Tip>
Half-point spreads eliminate the possibility of pushes, ensuring every bet has a clear winner or loser.
