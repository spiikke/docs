A moneyline bet is simply picking a team/player to win outright. Moneyline odds are listed for each side. If your chosen side wins, you win; if not, you lose.

## Example

**Yankees moneyline +150 vs Red Sox -160**

- Bet on Yankees: you profit $150 per $100 if they win
- Bet on Red Sox: profit $100 per $160 if they win

<Info>
**Important:** Moneyline bets include overtime/shootouts etc., unless otherwise specified.
