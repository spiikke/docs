Odds (aka lines) determine payout of a winning bet. In the U.S., American odds are used:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Positive Odds (e.g., +200)">

Indicates how much profit you win on a $100 bet.

**+200 means:** a $100 bet wins $200 profit (total payout $224, including your $100 stake)

</Tab>

<Tab title="Negative Odds (e.g., -150)">

Indicates how much you must bet to win $100.

**-150 means:** you bet $150 to win $100 profit (total payout $246, including the $150 stake)

</Tab>

## Example Calculation

If the 49ers are +124 and the Eagles are -146:

- A $100 bet on 49ers at +124 yields $124 profit (total payout $224, including your $100 stake)
- A $146 bet on Eagles at -146 yields $100 profit (total payout $246, including the $146 stake)

## Payout Formulas

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Negative Odds">

**Formula:** Winnings = (Wager × 100) / |Odds|

**Example:** $45 at -146: Winnings = (45×100)/146 ≈ $30.82 profit

</Tab>

<Tab title="Positive Odds">

**Formula:** Winnings = (Wager × Odds) / 100

**Example:** $65 at +124: Winnings = (65×124)/100 = $80.60 profit

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Minimum Odds Requirements

Some promotions require bets at minimum odds (e.g., "-120 or longer"):

- "-120 or longer" means odds must be -120, -110, +100, +150, etc. – you cannot bet heavy favorites like -150 or -300 for the promo
- If requirement is "-200 or longer", -190 qualifies (since -190 is greater than -200), but -250 would not

<Tip>
Understanding minimum odds requirements is crucial for qualifying promotions. Always check promo terms before placing bets.
