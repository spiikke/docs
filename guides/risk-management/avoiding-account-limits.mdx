## The Biggest Threat to Long-Term Profits

Account limitations are the primary risk in matched betting. Once limited, promotions become unprofitable since you can't bet enough to make them worthwhile. Prevention is crucial for maintaining long-term profitability.

<Warning>
A limited account can reduce your monthly profit potential by 80-90%.
