## The Only Real Risk in Matched Betting

Human error is the primary source of losses in matched betting. While the math guarantees profit when executed correctly, mistakes in bet placement, calculation, or timing can be costly.

A single major error can wipe out weeks or months of profits.

## Recovery Strategies

**If You Make an Error:**

1. **Don't panic** - assess the situation calmly
2. **Calculate exposure** - determine your maximum loss
3. **Look for hedging opportunities** - can you still hedge?
4. **Contact customer service** - some bets can be cancelled
5. **Learn from the mistake** - update your checklist

**Damage Control:**

If you can't cancel or hedge the error, consider these options:

- Place a smaller hedge to minimize loss
- Look for middle opportunities
- Use the error as a "recreational bet" for account health
- Factor the loss into your overall profit calculations
