## The Reality of Sportsbook Limits

Sportsbooks are businesses designed to make money from losing bettors. When you consistently win through matched betting, you become unprofitable for them.

<Warning>
**The Reality:** Account limitations are the primary risk in matched betting. Once limited, promotions become unprofitable since you can't bet enough to make them worthwhile.
</Warning>

## What Are Limits?

Limits are restrictions sportsbooks place on accounts that show profitable betting patterns. These can include:
