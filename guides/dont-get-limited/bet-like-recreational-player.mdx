## Blending In Strategy

The key to longevity is making your account look like a typical recreational bettor who occasionally gets lucky.

## Betting Patterns

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Mix in Recreational Bets" icon="check-circle">
Place small, non-promotional bets occasionally to show "normal" activity.

**Example:** Bet $25 on your favorite team's moneyline without any promo.
</Card>

<Card title="Vary Your Bet Sizes" icon="sliders">
Don't always bet the maximum promo amount or perfect round numbers.

**Instead of:** Always betting $500  
**Try:** $487, $523, $461
</Card>

<Card title="Skip Some Promotions" icon="pause">
Occasionally let a small promo go unused to appear less systematic.

**Strategy:** Skip 5-10% of smaller promos (under $20 value).
</Card>

<Card title="Bet Popular Markets" icon="trending-up">
Focus on mainstream sports and bet types where you blend in with the crowd.

**Safe choices:** NFL/NBA moneylines, spreads, and totals

### Time Your Bets Naturally

Don't place bets immediately when promos are released. Wait a few hours or bet during peak recreational times (evenings/weekends).

**Balance is Key:** You don't need to be perfect at camouflage. The goal is to extend your account's profitable lifespan, not to never get limited. Even with perfect stealth, limits may eventually come.
