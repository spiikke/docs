Understanding what triggers sportsbook attention is crucial for avoiding limits. Here are the biggest red flags:

<Warning>
**High-Risk Behaviors:**

- **Only Betting Promotions** - Placing bets exclusively when you have a bonus or promotional offer. Recreational bettors bet regularly, not just during promos.

- **Perfect Arbitrage Patterns** - Always betting exact amounts that guarantee profit regardless of outcome. Mathematical precision in bet sizing that eliminates all risk.

- **Immediate Withdrawals** - Withdrawing funds immediately after completing bonus requirements. Shows you're not a long-term customer, just extracting value.

- **Betting Obscure Markets** - Consistently betting on low-limit props or unusual markets. These markets are easier to manipulate and more closely monitored.

- **Round Number Betting** - Always betting exact amounts like $100, $250, $500. Real bettors often bet odd amounts like $73 or $127.

- **Beating Closing Lines** - Consistently getting better odds than what's available at game time. This suggests you have superior information or timing.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Medium-Risk Behaviors:**

- High win rates (above 55-60% long-term)
- Large bet sizes relative to account balance
- Betting maximum promo amounts consistently
- Using multiple devices or locations
- Frequent customer service contacts
</Info>

<Tip>
The key is to avoid these patterns consistently. One instance won't trigger limits, but repeated patterns will.
