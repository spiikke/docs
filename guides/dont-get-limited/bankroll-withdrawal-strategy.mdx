## Withdrawal Strategy

<Warning>
**What NOT to Do:**

- Withdraw immediately after completing bonus wagering
- Withdraw your entire balance at once

- Withdraw round amounts like exactly $1,000
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Smart Withdrawal Practices:**

- Wait 24-48 hours after bonus completion
- Leave some balance in your account
- Withdraw smaller amounts more frequently
- Use odd amounts like $847 or $1,234
- Space withdrawals at least a week apart

## Bankroll Management

### The 70/30 Rule

Keep 70% of your profits in play, withdraw 30% for personal use.

**Example:** If you profit $1,000, keep $700 across your sportsbook accounts and withdraw $300.

- Allows for more natural betting patterns

### Distribution Strategy

- Spread bankroll across multiple books
- Keep larger balances at player-friendly books
- Maintain smaller balances at quick-limit books
- Always keep enough for hedge bets
