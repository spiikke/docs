## Definition

Matched betting is a side hustle that mathematically guarantees profit from sportsbook promotions. It is not gambling because there's no risk of losing – you hedge bets to profit no matter the outcome.

## Key Concept

Use sportsbook offers (sign-up bonuses, bonus bets, profit boosts, etc.) and place offsetting bets so that one bet's win covers the other's loss.

## Legality

Matched betting is completely legal and possible anywhere online sports betting is allowed.

## Who Can Do It

Anyone of legal betting age in a location that permits online sports betting can start matched betting as a profitable side hustle.

## How Matched Betting Works

Sportsbook promotions tilt odds in your favor. To profit, you place one bet using the promotion and a "hedge" bet on another sportsbook. These bets are matched (on opposite outcomes), ensuring one will win. This is like betting on both "heads" and "tails" of a coin flip – one bet must win. Because one bet's win equals the other's loss, you lock in profit from the promotion.

**Matched betting vs gambling:** In gambling you could lose money on an outcome. In matched betting, you don't care who wins because your profit is guaranteed either way.

## Example: Second Chance Bet

A sportsbook offers a "Second Chance Bet" (refund if your first bet loses). You bet on Team A at Sportsbook 1 (with the promo) and bet on Team B at Sportsbook 2. One of those bets will win for sure. By choosing appropriate odds, you ensure the profit from the winning bet covers any cost on the other side, plus yields a net gain from the promo.

<Tip>
**Back vs Lay Bets:** In some contexts (especially UK), you'll hear back (bet on something to happen) and lay (bet against it) – the principle is similar, but matched bettors in the US usually just use two sportsbooks.

## Why Do Sportsbooks Offer Promotions?

Sportsbooks use promotions to attract and retain customers, expecting that in the long run they profit from the average gambler. Matched bettors take advantage of these promos for guaranteed profit. It's akin to banks offering sign-up bonuses – an incentive to use their service, except here there's much more money to be made in aggregate.

## Matched Betting vs Arbitrage

**Risk:** Arbitrage is riskier and leads to quicker account limitations (sportsbooks don't like it), whereas matched betting is easier and more sustainable.

## Profit Potential

You won't get rich enough to quit your job, but matched betting can be a sizable side income. Many Twin Odds members earn ~$1,000 per month; some earn much more after achieving VIP status with multiple sportsbooks. Initial earnings depend on how many sportsbooks are available in your state and your starting bankroll.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How much can I make?">

Sign-up offers alone can exceed $4,000 in many states. Ongoing promos can yield hundreds to a few thousand per month. Some heavy matched bettors (especially VIPs) make significantly more.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there a catch or risk?">

No catch. The main risk is human error – e.g. betting the wrong team or amount. Double-check bets and don't rush.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is matched betting legal worldwide?">

Yes – as long as you're betting in jurisdictions where online betting is legal. The strategy works anywhere with sportsbooks.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need deep sports knowledge?">

Not really. Knowing basics (moneyline, spread, etc.) helps avoid mistakes, but you don't need to be a sports expert.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I run out of new sign-up offers?">

Sportsbooks have ongoing promos for existing users (boosts, bet-and-gets, etc.). Using matched betting on those ensures continual profit.
