## How to Read Sportsbook Odds

Odds (aka lines) determine payout of a winning bet. In the U.S., American odds are used:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Positive Odds (e.g., +200)">

Indicates how much profit you win on a $100 bet.

**+200 means:** a $100 bet wins $200 profit (total payout $224, including your $100 stake)

</Tab>

<Tab title="Negative Odds (e.g., -150)">

Indicates how much you must bet to win $100.

**-150 means:** you bet $150 to win $100 profit (total payout $246, including the $150 stake)

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Example Calculation

If the 49ers are +124 and the Eagles are -146:

- A $100 bet on 49ers at +124 yields $124 profit (total payout $224, including your $100 stake)
- A $146 bet on Eagles at -146 yields $100 profit (total payout $246, including the $146 stake)

### Payout Formulas

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Negative Odds">

**Formula:** Winnings = (Wager × 100) / |Odds|

**Example:** $45 at -146: Winnings = (45×100)/146 ≈ $30.82 profit

</Tab>

<Tab title="Positive Odds">

**Formula:** Winnings = (Wager × Odds) / 100

**Example:** $65 at +124: Winnings = (65×124)/100 = $80.60 profit

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Minimum Odds Requirements

Some promotions require bets at minimum odds (e.g., "-120 or longer"):

- "-120 or longer" means odds must be -120, -110, +100, +150, etc. – you cannot bet heavy favorites like -150 or -300 for the promo
- If requirement is "-200 or longer", -190 qualifies (since -190 is greater than -200), but -250 would not

## What is a Moneyline?

A moneyline bet is simply picking a team/player to win outright. Moneyline odds are listed for each side. If your chosen side wins, you win; if not, you lose.

### Example

**Yankees moneyline +150 vs Red Sox -160**

- Bet on Yankees: you profit $150 per $100 if they win
- Bet on Red Sox: profit $100 per $160 if they win

<Info>
**Important:** Moneyline bets include overtime/shootouts etc., unless otherwise specified.
</Info>

## What is a Point Spread?

A spread (or line) is a handicap to even the playing field. You bet on a team to cover the spread:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Favorite (-5.5)">

Must win by 6 or more for a bet on them to win

</Tab>

<Tab title="Underdog (+5.5)">

Can lose by 5 or fewer, or win outright, and a bet on them wins

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Push Concept

If the result lands exactly on the spread (for whole number spreads), it's usually a push (bet refunded). Spreads often use half-points to avoid pushes.

## What is a Total (Over/Under)?

A total bet is wagering on the combined score of both teams being over or under a set number.

### Example: NFL Game Total 47.5

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Over 47.5">

Wins if 48 or more points are scored

</Tab>

<Tab title="Under 47.5">

Wins if 47 or fewer points are scored

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
**Note:** If total was an integer and the exact number is hit, that's a push (though books often use .5 increments to avoid pushes).
</Info>
