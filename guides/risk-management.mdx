## Avoiding Account Limits

Account limitations are the primary risk in matched betting. Once limited, promotions become unprofitable since you can't bet enough to make them worthwhile. Prevention is crucial for maintaining long-term profitability.

<Warning>
A limited account can reduce your monthly profit potential by 80-90%.

### Risk Management Rules

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="The 5% Rule" icon="percent">
Never risk more than 5% of your total bankroll on any single promotion or bet. This protects against catastrophic losses from human error or unexpected outcomes.
</Card>

<Card title="The 2x Coverage Rule" icon="layer-group">
Always maintain at least 2x the bet amount across all your sportsbook accounts to ensure you can properly hedge any position.
</Card>

<Card title="The Emergency Fund" icon="piggy-bank">
Keep 10-20% of your bankroll as an emergency fund for unexpected situations, account issues, or exceptional opportunities.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Distribution Strategy

**Recommended Bankroll Allocation:**

- **Primary Books (3-4 major sportsbooks):** 60-70%
- **Secondary Books (2-3 additional books):** 20-25%
- **Emergency Reserve:** 10-15%

<Warning>
**Avoid These Mistakes:**

- Putting all funds in one sportsbook
- Not maintaining adequate hedge book balances
- Chasing losses with larger bets
- Withdrawing too frequently (triggers scrutiny)
</Warning>

## Preventing Human Error

Human error is the primary source of losses in matched betting. While the math guarantees profit when executed correctly, mistakes in bet placement, calculation, or timing can be costly.

<Warning>
A single major error can wipe out weeks or months of profits.

- Use bookmarks for quick access to bet slips
</Tip>

### Recovery Strategies

**If You Make an Error:**

1. **Don't panic** - assess the situation calmly
2. **Calculate exposure** - determine your maximum loss
3. **Look for hedging opportunities** - can you still hedge?
4. **Contact customer service** - some bets can be cancelled
5. **Learn from the mistake** - update your checklist

**Damage Control:**

If you can't cancel or hedge the error, consider these options:

- Place a smaller hedge to minimize loss
