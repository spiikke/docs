## What is Stacking?

Promotion stacking means using more than one promo on the same event or series of bets to multiply your profit. Instead of doing promotions separately, you strategically combine them for maximum efficiency.

<Info>
**Example:** Use a risk-free bet on one sportsbook and a profit boost on another sportsbook for the same game, hedging them against each other.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="When Stacking Works" icon="check-circle">
- Different sportsbooks offer complementary promotions
- Promotions don't conflict with each other's terms
- You can hedge one promo against another
- The combined value exceeds doing them separately
- You have sufficient bankroll for both sides
</Card>

<Card title="When NOT to Stack" icon="x-circle">
- Same sportsbook (usually prohibited)
- Conflicting terms and conditions
- Risk of voiding both promotions
- Insufficient bankroll to cover both sides
- Better EV doing them separately
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Important Warning:** Always read promotion terms carefully. Some offers explicitly prohibit combining with other promotions. Violating terms can void both promotions and potentially lead to account restrictions.
</Warning>

## Stacking Examples

Here are real-world examples of successful promotion stacking strategies.

### Example 1: Risk-Free + Profit Boost Stack

**Scenario:**

- DraftKings: $500 Risk-Free Bet on Lakers vs Warriors
- FanDuel: 50% Profit Boost (up to $50 extra winnings) on same game

**Strategy:**

1. Bet $500 on Lakers +110 at DraftKings (risk-free)
2. Bet $100 on Warriors -110 at FanDuel (with boost)
3. Hedge remaining exposure on third book

**Outcomes:**

- If Lakers win: Profit from DK + boost value
- If Warriors win: Get $500 refund + boosted winnings
- Either way: ~$150-200 total profit

### Example 2: Double Risk-Free Stack

**Scenario:**

- Caesars: $1000 Risk-Free Bet
- BetMGM: $1000 Risk-Free Bet
- Same game, opposite sides

**Execution:**

1. Bet $1000 on Team A at Caesars
2. Bet $1000 on Team B at BetMGM
3. One bet wins (~$900), other loses (gets refunded as bonus bet)

**Result:**

- Immediate profit: ~$900 from winning bet
- Bonus bet to convert: $1000 (worth ~$700)
- Total profit: ~$1600 from two risk-free bets
- vs. ~$1400 if done separately on different games

### Example 3: Bet & Get + Odds Boost Stack

**Scenario:**

- PointsBet: "Bet $50 on NBA, Get $10 Bonus Bet"
- Barstool: Enhanced odds on opposite outcome (+150 → +200)

**Approach:**

1. Bet $50 on Over 220.5 at PointsBet
2. Bet $40 on Under 220.5 at Barstool (boosted)
3. Small qualifying loss, but get bonus + boost value

**Profit:**

- Qualifying loss: ~$2-3
- Bonus bet value: ~$7
- Boost value: ~$8-12
- Net profit: ~$12-16

## Common Stacking Mistakes

Avoid these critical errors that can cost you money and potentially void your promotions.

### Mistake 1: Same-Book Stacking

<Warning>
**What NOT to do:** Trying to use multiple promotions on the same sportsbook account for one bet. For example, attempting to use a profit boost AND a risk-free bet on the same wager at DraftKings.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Correct Approach:** Use promotions from different sportsbooks. One promo per book, hedge across multiple books.
</Tip>

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Terms & Conditions

**Common Oversights:**

- Not checking minimum odds requirements
- Missing exclusions (e.g., "cannot be combined with other offers")
- Overlooking market restrictions
- Ignoring time limits and expiration dates

<Tip>
**Prevention:** Always read full terms for each promotion. Create a checklist to verify compatibility before stacking.
</Tip>

### Mistake 3: Inadequate Bankroll Management

<Warning>
**The Problem:** Stacking large promotions without sufficient bankroll to cover all positions. This can leave you with unhedged exposure or force you to take poor odds.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Solution:** Ensure you have 2-3x the total bet amount available across all books before attempting to stack large promotions.
</Tip>

### Mistake 4: Poor Timing and Execution

**Timing Errors:**

- Placing bets too close to game time (odds movement risk)
- Not coordinating bet placement across books
- Forgetting about promotion expiration times

**Best Practices:**

- Plan your stack in advance
- Place bets simultaneously when possible
- Have backup plans if odds move unfavorably
- Set reminders for promotion deadlines

## Advanced Stacking Techniques

These advanced techniques require significant experience, large bankrolls, and careful execution. Only attempt after mastering basic stacking principles.

### Multi-Book Parlay Stacking

**Concept:**

Use parlay insurance promotions on multiple books while hedging individual legs to guarantee profit regardless of outcomes.

**Setup Example:**

- FanDuel: 3-leg parlay with insurance
- DraftKings: Same 3-leg parlay with insurance
- Hedge individual legs on other books

<Warning>
**Complexity:** Requires calculating multiple scenarios and having sufficient bankroll to hedge 6+ positions simultaneously.
</Warning>

### VIP Promotion Stacking

VIP players receive exclusive, high-value promotions that can be stacked for significantly larger profits than standard offers.

**Example VIP Stack:**

- Caesars VIP: 25% deposit match up to $2500
- DraftKings VIP: Weekly $1000 risk-free bet
- BetMGM VIP: 100% profit boost up to $500 extra

**Potential combined value:** $3000+ per week

<Tip>
**Requirements:**

- $10,000+ bankroll minimum
- VIP status on multiple books
- Ability to handle high-volume betting
- Advanced risk management skills
</Tip>

### Cross-Sport Stacking

**Strategy:**

Combine promotions across different sports to maximize daily profit potential while spreading risk and avoiding detection.

<Card title="NBA Tuesday" icon="basketball">

<Card title="MLB Wednesday" icon="baseball">

</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Seasonal Mega-Stacks

During major events (March Madness, Super Bowl), multiple books offer overlapping promotions that can be stacked for massive profits.

**March Madness Example:**

Bracket insurance + daily game boosts + parlay promotions across 8+ books

**Super Bowl Example:**

Prop bet insurance + enhanced odds + halftime promotions + touchdown specials

<Warning>
**Warning:** Seasonal mega-stacks require exceptional planning, large bankrolls ($25,000+), and the ability to manage 20+ simultaneous positions.
</Warning>
