Matched betting is a mathematical strategy that converts free bets and promotional offers from sportsbooks into guaranteed cash profits. Unlike traditional gambling, matched betting eliminates risk by covering all possible outcomes of an event.

**Key Principle:** By placing opposing bets on the same event across different platforms, you ensure a profit regardless of the outcome. This is possible because sportsbooks offer promotional bets that have real cash value.
