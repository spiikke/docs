There are two main types of arbitrage betting strategies, each with different profit potentials and risk profiles.

## Bonus Arbitrage (Matched Betting)

The most profitable form of arbitrage that leverages sportsbook promotions like free bets, bonus bets, and risk-free offers.

**Benefits:**

- Higher profit margins (typically 70-80% of free bet value)
- Uses promotional offers as leverage
- Completely risk-free when done correctly

## Odds Arbitrage

Exploiting small discrepancies in odds across different sportsbooks to guarantee small profits.

**Characteristics:**

- Lower profit margins (typically 1-5%)
- Requires larger bankrolls
- More time-sensitive opportunities

<Warning>
Arbitrage is riskier and leads to quicker account limitations (sportsbooks don't like it), whereas matched betting is easier and more sustainable.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Focus on matched betting (bonus arbitrage) rather than pure odds arbitrage for better long-term profitability and account longevity.
