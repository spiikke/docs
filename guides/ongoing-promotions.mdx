## Matched Betting After Sign-up Offers

Once you've completed all sign-up bonuses, sportsbooks continue offering promotions to keep users engaged. These ongoing offers can provide steady daily profit for experienced matched bettors.

<Info>
**Example:** 10 sportsbooks × $5/day = $50/day ≈ $18,000/year in risk-free profit
</Info>

### Using the Promo Dashboard

Because there are so many ongoing promotions, use the Promo Dashboard to find them efficiently. Twin Odds aggregates all current promotions from your connected sportsbooks in one place.

<Tip>
**Types of recurring offers:**

- "Bet and Get" promotions
- Odds boosts
- Parlay insurance
- Deposit matches for existing users
- Seasonal promos (March Madness, NFL parlays, etc.)
</Tip>

## Offer Types Recap

A refresher on the core matched betting approach that applies to all ongoing promotions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Second Chance Bet" icon="rotate-ccw">
If your bet loses, you get a refund bet/credit. Expected value: ~50-70% of promo amount.
</Card>

</Card>

<Card title="Site Credit" icon="wallet">

</Card>

<Card title="Profit Boost" icon="trending-up">

</Card>

<Card title="Qualifying Bet" icon="target">

## Real Examples

### FanDuel's Dinger Tuesday

This is a very popular weekly promo during baseball season:

<Info>
On Tuesdays, for any MLB game, bet $25 on a player to hit a home run. For each home run hit in that game (by either team), you get a $5 Bonus Bet. Max $25 bonus per game. You can do this for every game each Tuesday (sometimes 15 games).

So effectively, it's a high volume promo: up to $25 × 15 = $375 in bonus bets possible each Tuesday.
</Info>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Matched Betting (Hedged) Approach" icon="shield">
Place a $25 HR prop on FanDuel, then hedge that bet on another book. This guarantees minimal loss or break-even on the bet itself, and you keep the bonus bets as profit.

**Pro:** Almost zero risk  
**Con:** Time-intensive for 15 games
</Card>

<Card title="No-Hedge Approach" icon="rocket">
Treat it like a value bet. Bet all games' HR props without hedging, expecting that over the season the bonus bet returns outweigh losses.

**Pro:** Likely higher profit in expectation  
**Con:** Has variance, need big bankroll
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**Key Stats:** Average ~2 HRs per game historically, meaning each game's $25 bet yields about $10 in bonus (2 HR × $5) on average. Bonus bet expected value ~70%, so that $10 in bonus is worth $7 real money.
</Tip>

### Other Promotion Examples

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="MGM 'Bet & Get'" icon="dollar-sign">
"Bet $50 on NHL, Get $10"

**Strategy:** Place $50 NHL bet, hedge on another book. Small qualifying loss to secure $10 bonus.
</Card>

<Card title="BetRivers NFL/NHL Bet & Get" icon="layers">
"Bet $X on NFL and $X on NHL, get a bonus"

**Strategy:** Treat each part separately to hedge.
</Card>

<Card title="FanDuel Bet Match" icon="handshake">
"Get $50 in site credit if you bet $50 on a certain game"

**Strategy:** Place required bet and hedge it.
</Card>

<Card title="DraftKings Profit Boost (NBA)" icon="trending-up">
"+100% profit boost on an NBA same-game parlay"

**Strategy:** Use boost on longer odds bet, hedge if possible.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Takeaway

After sign-ups, you continue by systematically doing all daily promos in a matched betting fashion. They "add up quickly" - even if each individual promo is small (say $5-$20 value each), having many books can yield steady daily profit.

### The Strategy

**For Bet & Gets and Bet Matches:**

Place the required bet and hedge it (likely at a small loss) to secure the "get", then convert the bonus.

**For profit boosts:**

Use the profit boost on a bet that maximizes expected value (often a longer odds bet up to the max win allowed, hedged if possible).

**For multi-part promos:**

Just treat each part separately to hedge, or sometimes no hedge if it's small, depending on expected value.

<Tip>
**Remember:** The key is consistency. Small daily profits from multiple books add up to significant monthly earnings over time.
